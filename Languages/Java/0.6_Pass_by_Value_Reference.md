  Purpose: Java pass by value and reference notes
-->

# Overview
- Everything strictly pass-by-value.

# Pass-by-Value
- Parameters passed to the callee are copies of original parameters. One does not affect the other.

# Pass-by-Reference
- Caller and callee operate on the same object. Changes affect the original.

# Parameter Passing
- Primitive variables store the actual values; non-primitives store the reference variables which point to the address of the object they're referring to.
  - Values and references stored in stack memory.
    - References in stack memory are pointers to memory on the heap (objects dynamically stored in the heap in Java).
- Arguments are always pass-by-value.

# Visual examples

## Pass by value ##

Stack     Method called   Method modification
| x=1 |   | x=1  |        | x=1  |
| y=2 |   | y=2  |        | y=2  |
|     |   | x1=1 |        | x1=3 |
|     |   | y1=2 |        | y2=4 |


## Pass by reference ##

### Assume Object A address 0x10
#### Member 'x' = 1
### Assume Object B address 0xDE
#### Member 'x' = 2

Stack           Method called    Method Modification
| refA->0x10 |  | refA->0x10  |  [0x10].x = 3
| refB->0xDE |  | refB->0xDE  |  [0xDE].x = 4
|            |  | refA1->0x10 |
|            |  | refB1->0xDE |
```
