  Purpose: Java Classes and Objects
-->

# Overview
- Classes: blueprints or templates for objects.
- Objects: *living entities* created from classes.

# Classes
- Every class has an empty constructor by default. Use it if don't provide specific implementation.

# Objects
- Created from classes at *runtime*.
- AKA instances

# Access Modifiers
- `default`: All members visible within same package.
  - Given when don't use keyword explicitly.
- `public`: Can be used in any package.
  - All classes in all packages. "Global".
- `private`: Accessible from the same class only.
- `protected`: Access from same package and all subclasses of its class (even if in other packages).

 | Modifier | Class | Package | Subclass | World |
 | -------- | ----- | ------- | -------- | ----- |
 | public | Y | Y | Y | Y |
 | protected | Y | Y | Y | N |
 | default | Y | Y | N | N |
 | private | Y | N | N | N |


## Public Harm
- Overusing violates OOP encapsulation principle.
- Cons:
  - Increase size of APIs.
  - Difficult to update or refactor code (especially in APIs).
  - Harder to track down unintentional variable changes.
  - More work if a data type needs to be changed.
    - Users will have to change their own implementation.
  - Not thread-safe; can't control changing their references or states in different threads.

## Private Usage
- Private constructors can only be used within the class.
  - Adding `static` methods allows for usage outside the class.
```java
// Constr class
private Constr(int x, String name, int priv) {
  this.x = x;
  this.name = name;
  this.priv = priv;
}

public static builder(int x, String name) {
  return new Constr(x, name, 0x1098);
}

// Usage outside class
Constr constr = Constr.builder(23, "John");
```

- Private methods can only be used within the class.
```java
// All one class
private void incMoney(int step) {
  this.money += step;
}

public void pay(int amt) {
  incMoney(amt);
}
```
- Private classes are only possible if they're inner classes.
  - Private general classes deemed useless/unusable.
```java
public class Outer {
  public Inner getInnerInstance() {
    Inner inner = this.new Inner();
    inner.id = 0x3456;
    inner.x = 3.14159;
    return inner
  }

  private class Inner {
    public int id;
    public double x;
  }
}
```

# Concrete Class
- Class we can create an instance of using `new`.
- All methods must be implemented.
- Can also implement interfaces.
```java
public class Car extends Vehicle implements Driveable {
  public String honk() {
    return "beep";
  }

  // drive() already implemented
}
```

## Abstract Class
- Not all methods are implemented (*abstraction*).
- Disallows for instance creation.
- Can be sub-classed.
- Marked with `abstract` keyword.
- Other classes `extend` it.
- Follow *open-close* principle.
  - *open* for extension, *closed* for modification.
```java
public abstract class Vehicle {
  public abstract String honk();

  public String drive() {
    return "zoom";
  }
}
```
## Interfaces
- Blueprint for a class consisting of unimplemented method signatures.
- Uses `interface` keyword instead of `class`.
- Can't be instantiated directly.
- Can be empty.
- Can't use `final` in inheritance.
- Interface Methods can't be `protected` or `final`.
- Methods can't be `private` up until Java 9.
- All declarations should have `public` or default access modifier.
  - `abstract` added by compiler.
- Variables `public`, `static`, and `final` (by definition); we can't change their visibility.
- Other classes `implement`  it.
```java
interface Driveable {
  void honk();
  void drive();
}
```

# Constructors
- Build the initial state of the object being created.
```java
// No-argument constructor
// - Built by constructor if no constructor explicitly given
class A {
  public A() {
    this.name = "";
    this.x = 0;
    this.y = 90.0D;
  }
}

// Parameterized
public A(String name, int x, double y) {
  this.name = name;
  this.x = x;
  this.y = y;
}

// Copy Constructor
public A(A a) {
  this.name = a.name;
  this.x = a.x;
  this.y = a.y;
}

// Chained
public A(String name, int x, double y) {
  this.name = name;
  this.x = x;
  this.y = y;
}

public A(String name) {
  this(name, 0, 90.0D); // Like super, "this" should always be first statement!
}
```

## Value Objects
- Object that does not (can't) change its internal state after initialization.
  - AKA immutable object.
- Thread safe and side-effect free.
- Use `final` on members.
  - Every member *must* be initialized.
```java
class A() {
  final String name;
  final int x;
  final double y;

  public A(String name, int x, int y) {
    this.name = name;
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
  }
}
```
