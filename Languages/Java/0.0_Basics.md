# Overview
- Statically typed, object-oriented language.
- Platform independent.

# Data Types
- **Primitive types**: basic data types that store simple data and form foundation of data manipulation.
  - Integers (int long byte short), floating-point (float double), character (char), and logical (boolean).
- **Reference types**: objects that contain references to values and/or other objects or *null*.

# Arrays
- Reference type that can store a collection of values of a specific type (primitive or reference).
  - `type[] identifier = new type[length]`.

```java
// Example java program structure

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int a = 12;
    int b = 90;
    int c = a + b;
    System.out.println(a + " + " + b + " = " + c);
  }
}
