  Purpose: Java Initialization Basics
-->

# Instance and Class Variables
- Don't require initialization.
  - Given default values as soon as we declare them (normally a 0 equivalent).
# Local Variables
- Must be initialized before use.
- Don't have default values.

# Initializers
- Block of code that has no associated name or data type.
- Placed outside any method, constructor, or another block of code.
## Instance Initializers
- Used to initialize instance variables.
```java
{
  id = 0;
}
```
## Static Initialization Block
- Block to initialize `static` fields.
```java
static {
  id = 0;
}
```

# Order of Initialization
 1. static variables and initializers (in order).
 2. Instance variables and instance initializers (in order).
 3. Constructors.

# Object Lifecycle
- Obsolete objects managed by Java's garbage collecter.
  - Garbage collector only deals with items in heap memory.
  - Obsolete object means: 
    - Object no longer has any references pointing to it.
    - All refernces pointing to object are out of scope.

# Object Creation
```java
// Basic
MyObj a = new MyObj("John", 23);

// Reflection
MyObj b = MyObj.getConstructor(String.class, int.class)
  .newInstance("John", 23);

// Cloning
MyObj c = (MyObj) b.clone();

// Allocate without calling constructor
// - Requires sun.misc.Unsafe
MyObj d = (MyObj) unsafeInstance.allocateInstance(MyObj.class);
